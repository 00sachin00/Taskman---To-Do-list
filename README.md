# Taskman---To-Do-list
I made this little to-do list/Task manager chrome extension using javascript.
it's a simple application, but it has some issues that i wasn't able to solve since i didn't have enough time.
i used localStorage to store and retrieve data, instead of database.

Feautues: Add Tasks, Remove tasks, Mark tasks as finished.

How to install:
1. Download and extract folder
2. open chrome, go to 'More tools' and click 'Extensions'.
3. Click on 'Load unpacked' from above, Select the folder directory and click 'Select folder'.
4. Extension will be loaded to the browser, Now you can start using it.

Known issue: Every task is saved to localStorage but without their finished/unfinished status, that means if you have marked some task as finished, when you re-open the extension, finished task will again become unmarked.

If you can make some changes to this app(Even a little), you're most welcomed. please make a pull request and i will gladly accept it, Thanks :)
